# How to use Lily's React App

## Getting started
Make sure you have Node and NPM installed!

## Starting the application
Change into the foo directory and run
```
npm run start
```
Then, go into Chrome and open http://localhost:3000

## Installing a new package
Change into the foo directory and run
```
npm install my-cool-package
```

Usually, the instructions will say `npm install my-cool-package` but just replace `npm install` with `yarn add`.
## Looking for error messages
Look in the terminal tab where you ran `npm run start` or have `View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console` open in Chrome while you run the app.

## Change the state of the app
Pattern match, look how I changed it with the button in App.js

## Put everything on git 
Change into the foo directory and run
```
make upload
```
This is big-time cheating, I make a little script that will do all the git things for you. You have a lot to learn!
